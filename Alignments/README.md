Alignments

RV A serotypes (A102, A105, A39, A57, A58, A78, A82) were mapped to 1AYM to produce 3D capsid model and for surface area accessibility analysis. RVB06, RVB97, RVC28, RVC36 and 1AYM were mapped to 4GB3 for deep mutational scanning analysis. RVB06, RVB97, RVC28 and RVC36 were also mapped to 1AYM for easier comparison between serotypes for epitope, interpentamer, protein structure and surface exposure analysis.

Reference fastas for each patient were annotated using ICTV (https://ictv.global/report/chapter/picornaviridae/picornaviridae/enterovirus). VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1 regions were extracted and translated to a protein sequences. Each species was aligned using HHpred to 1AYM and 4GB3. iSNV that fell in place where there were gaps in either of the aligned species were removed for the analysis.

All alignments are stored as Fastas in the allignments folder.
