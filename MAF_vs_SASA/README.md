MAF_vs_SASA

Files for 3d capsid model generation and surface area accessibility analysis are stored in the MAF_vs_SASA folder.

Add_Colors_Pymol.py takes SASA_Annotated.csv as input and outputs iSNV residues for 1AYM with color based on a scale range between red and yellow extracted from the AF percentage. Output can also be adjusted to filter based on day range.

Pymol_Inputs.txt has a brief description to generate the 1AYM capsid in pymol and color each VP region. Paste the output of Add_Colors_Pymol.py to color all the residues.

SASA_Pymol.txt was produced using the surface area accessibility function in Pymol. Capsid was dehydrated prior to surface area analysis. SASA_Pymol.txt was converted to SASA_Extracted_Pymol.csv in excel using text to column options to remove unnecessary columns.

#Pymol Capsid Graph is an r script used used to add color scale to exported pymol images, and adds color guide for the VP regions. Further repositioning of elements was done in Inscape.

Annotate_Pymol_Position.py takes SASA_Dataframe.csv, SASA_Extracted_Pymol.csv

and alignments for RV_A in the Alignments folder as input. The python program maps all iSNVs to 1AYM for RV A, removing any iSNVs that donâ€™t map properly (gaps) and also adds surface area accessibly information to each iSNV stored as the output file SASA_Annotated.csv.

#MAF vs SASA was an R script used to graph AF against surface area accessibility with iSNVs colored by group and the graph faceted V region. No VP4 region is fetured in the graph as it is mostly internal.
