Epitopes 

Epitope_Translation.py is a python script which takes, ALL_LAVA_Output.csv, 1AYM_A.csv 

And Epitope_Position_Updated.csv as input. It maps RVB and RVC species to 1AYM and removes iSNVs that did not map properly.  

The program produces Epitope_A_B_C.csv which is an epitope list merged to the iSNV list to show which iSNVs occurred within an epitope region. It also produces the file 1AYM_Allignment_All.csv which is a data frame of RV iSNVs serotypes mapped to 1AYM. 

 

#Chi Square Epitope is an r script which preforms chi square 2x2 test on epitope output
